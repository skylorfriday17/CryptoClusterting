# CryptoClusterting

All of the code I used was either already provided for me or pulled from class material from module 19. I used previous lesson activities to guide me through the activity. To find the notebook in my repo that contains all of my code you can click on [Crypto_Clustering.ipynb](Crypto_Clustering.ipynb).
